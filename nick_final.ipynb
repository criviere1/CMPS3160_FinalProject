    "# Project Goals\n",
    "The team, **Nick Ouellet and Garrett Gilliom**, will likely be investigating data sets related to Louisiana public school districts that measure student, faculty, and staff demographics, performance, district finances, and more. So far, the team has come across two data sets that measure different variables and attributes of the Louisiana school districts across the same year that appear to be well-populated. The website in which the analysis is located can be found [here](https://nickouellet.github.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Plan\n",
    "The team plans to meet once a week to work on this project to finalize our project vision, determine objectives, and assist each other where necessary. We will also be communicating thoroughly over text messages to keep each other updated with task progress and will be using Google Docs to keep an ongoing list of to-do items that’s accessible by each of us at all times. The team has also set up a shared Github repository to store, coordinate, and update our code."

    "## Table 1: \n",
    "This first table is from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Common Code of Data (CCD). Their website allows users to make specific queries to their database to get personalized data; the team opted to focus on Louisiana public school districts, each of which is its own observation and row, and included nearly all variable measurements to be included for each district, including diversity levels within the district, pupil/teacher ratio, total revenue from different sources, and expenditures. The team chose this data set because it provides data on many points and variables that may be relevant upon further investigation when answering questions such as, “What school districts are given the most funding?” “In what school districts are teachers compensated the most?” “How do expenditures align with compensation?” and “Is there any correlation between student demographics, including sex, gender, race, and/or ethnicity, and these measurements?” Furthermore, its source is reputable and trustable, being the U.S. Department of Education. However, the team also recognizes that the variables included in the requested dataset were chosen with inherent bias; it is the team’s goal to limit this bias as much as possible, and therefore will best attempt to objectively review what measurements are necessary or relevant in future milestones and project submissions."

Each school district is, again, separated as their own observation, which marks school districts as the unit of observation across both this and the former dataset. Again, this dataset comes from a reputable source, being the Louisiana Department of Education; the data also recognizes that some of its measurements may not be too complete or are unreliable and marks values as such; however, nearly every cell is filled in, so little cleaning will need to be done otherwise. This dataset may provide insight into questions such as, “What school districts perform best in Louisiana?” “What performance-related measurements correlate with each other?” “What are poorly performing districts struggling with?” and “What might poorly performing districts attempt to focus on to improve?”\n"

    "The team is also interested in what relationships the two datasets have with each other, considering they cover different aspects of the same units of observations, those being demographic measurements and performance measurements. Questions such as, “What are the demographics of schools that perform best/worst?” “How do compensation rates compare between well and poorly performing schools?” “How relevant is the pupil/teacher ratio in academic performance?” and “Does school size have any impact on graduation rate or academic performance?” These are the questions the team is most interested in: the ones that relate to both datasets and will require the merging and/or comparing of the two, rather than just looking at each individually. Eventually, the team would like to create a model based on the data from these tables to predict the test scores of districts around the country based on their information from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Common Code of Data (CCD). This would, of course, requires more datasets to be parsed and tidied – which would be done once our initial exploratory analysis is completed."
